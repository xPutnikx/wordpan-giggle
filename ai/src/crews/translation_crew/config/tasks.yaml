translation_suggestions_task:
  description: >
    Translate the word "{word}" from {native_language} to {target_language}.

    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Provide exactly 3 translation suggestions
    - Each suggestion should be a different translation option (consider different contexts, formality levels, or meanings)
    - Order suggestions by confidence/appropriateness (most common/accurate first)
    - Consider grammatical forms, conjugations, and natural usage in the target language
    - Provide context for when each translation is most appropriate
    - If the word has multiple meanings, include different translations for different contexts

    You must return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    {{
      "suggestions": [
        {{
          "translation": "translation1",
          "confidence": 0.95,
          "context": "Most common usage, appropriate for everyday conversation"
        }},
        {{
          "translation": "translation2",
          "confidence": 0.85,
          "context": "Alternative form or context-specific usage"
        }},
        {{
          "translation": "translation3",
          "confidence": 0.75,
          "context": "Less common but valid translation option"
        }}
      ]
    }}

    Where each suggestion has:
    - "translation": the translated word in the target language
    - "confidence": a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating accuracy/commonness
    - "context": a brief explanation of when this translation is most appropriate
  expected_output: >
